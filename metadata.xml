    <description>A mod that slightly expands the co-op mode. You have probably often come across the fact that sometimes it is difficult to figure out where who is, this mod highlights characters with color and displays his name.

Use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config Menu[/url] to customize the mod for yourself.

The mod is fully compatible with the [b]Repentance[/b] add-on.</description>
