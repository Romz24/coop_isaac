# [REP] Co-op plus

A mod that expands and adds accessibility features to co-op mode in **Repentance**.

If you've been playing in co-op a lot, you've probably noticed by now that it's really easy to lose yourself on the screen and get confused about which character you're controlling sometimes. This mod aims to add several accessibility features, all configurable through [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818) to alleviate that, and overall improve the co-op experience.

**Currently, it adds the following features:**
1. Colored Player Labels
2. Player Label Opacity
3. Colored Players
4. Colored Tears
5. Per-Player Color Customization
6. Ghost Visibility
7. Ghost Flight
